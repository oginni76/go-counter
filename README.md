This counts the number of lines in your code and returns the total sum.

Bugs to fix from the initial phase
a. Doesn't give the sum when it encounters an error, it shows the individual files and their number of lines but doesn't show total if it encounters an error
b. Some files should be ignored (eg .gits hidden files)
